Customer_Churn_Prediction
This project is to analyze customer data and predict which customers will continue the service. This was completed as part of the Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). We have performed the following algorithms - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree , Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine.
The visualization of data performed in exploratory data analysis showed clearly which of the features are more and less correlated with the target variable(CHURN).
